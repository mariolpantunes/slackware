# My slackbuilds
## About

The objective of this repository is to store and share my slackbuilds.
Like most I submit my slackbuilds to [slackbuilds.org](http://slackbuilds.org/).
But until the slackbuilds are accepted they are available through here.

##Slackbuilds
1. Openfire 3.7.1
2. Leveldb 1.7
3. ZeroMQ-JZMQ
4. Jabref
