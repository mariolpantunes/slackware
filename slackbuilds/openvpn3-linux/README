OpenVPN 3 Linux client

This is the next generation OpenVPN client for Linux. 
This project is very different from the more classic OpenVPN 2.x versions. 
First, this is currently only a pure client-only implementation.

The biggest change from the classic OpenVPN 2.x generation is that it does 
not need to be started by a root or otherwise privileged account any more. 
By default, all users on the system will have access to start and manage 
their own VPN tunnels. It will also support configuring DNS out-of-the-box.

The same OpenVPN 3 Core library which is used in the OpenVPN Connect 
clients is also used in this OpenVPN 3 client. This implementation does 
not support all options OpenVPN 2.x does, but if you have a functional 
configuration with OpenVPN Connect (typically on Android or iOS devices) 
it will work with this client. In general OpenVPN 3 supports routed TUN 
configurations; TAP and bridged setups are unsupported and will not work.

On a more technical level, this client builds on D-Bus and does also 
ship with a Python 3 module which can also be used to implement your own 
OpenVPN client front-end. Any language which supports D-Bus bindings can 
also be used.
