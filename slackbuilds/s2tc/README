S2TC's format specification is very easy to implement, so it is not hard to make a working compressor or decompressor for it.
It is based on Color Cell Compression from 1986, and decoding is done entirely using the methods from there.
Encoding is done using a search and refinement method that is derived from the methods described in that paper.
This also makes this format a great platform for learning about texture compression and how to tune a compressor for best quality.
