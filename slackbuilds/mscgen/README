Mscgen is a small program that parses Message Sequence Chart
descriptions and produces PNG, SVG, EPS or server side image maps
(ismaps) as the output. Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are a way of
representing entities and interactions over some time period and are
often used in combination with SDL. MSCs are popular in Telecoms to
specify how protocols operate although MSCs need not be complicated to
create or use. Mscgen aims to provide a simple text language that is
clear to create, edit and understand, which can also be transformed into
common image formats for display or printing.

This program and the language it parses have been inspired by
Graphviz Dot, which provides a really good way to document State
Transition Diagrams, data structures and directed graphs. Unlike
Graphviz, this program does no clever layout operations or spline
routing as this is not needed for MSCs, and so was much simpler to
implement. Doxygen (version 1.5.2 onwards) also allows MSCs to be
embedded directly in the same way that dot diagrams can be added to
documentation, making it easy to improve Doxygen generated documentation
through the use of message sequence charts.
