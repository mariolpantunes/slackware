Openfire is a real time collaboration (RTC) server licensed under the Open Source Apache License.
It uses the only widely adopted open protocol for instant messaging, XMPP (also called Jabber).
Openfire is incredibly easy to setup and administer, but offers rock-solid security and performance.

This script repacks the tar.gz into a slackware package.
It also links /etc/rc.d/rc.openfire to the correct binary.

## Startup
To have this start upon each boot, add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

<<<<<<< HEAD
  # Start openfire
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.openfire ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.openfire start
  fi

You will also want to put the following into /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
(if that file does not exist, create it and make it executable):

  # Stop openfire
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.openfire ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.openfire stop
  fi
=======
	# Start openfire
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.openfire ]; then
	   /etc/rc.d/rc.openfire start
	fi
