OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD version.

Added symbolic link to install a generic blas library that can be used by
Octave and R.
OpenBLAS has cpu specific targetted assembly code for speed optimisation.
In most cases, the installation will detect the correct CPU architecture.
However, if you want to specify the architecture you can define the EXTRAPARAMS
environmental variable with EXTRAPARAMS="TARGET=ZEN" (example for AMD Ryzen CPUs).
