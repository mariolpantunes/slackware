This tool was originally developed to fix Linux CPU throttling issues affecting Lenovo T480 / T480s / X1C6 as described here.

The CPU package power limit (PL1/2) is forced to a value of 44 W (29 W on battery) and the temperature trip point to 95 'C (85 'C on battery) by overriding default values in MSR and MCHBAR every 5 seconds (30 on battery) to block the Embedded Controller from resetting these values to default.
