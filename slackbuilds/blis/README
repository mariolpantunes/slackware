BLIS (BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software)

BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance
BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries.

This package builds BLIS with the BLAS and CBLAS compatibility layers enabled.
It creates symbolic links for libblas.so and libcblas.so, allowing BLIS to
serve as a transparent replacement for standard BLAS libraries in applications
like R, Octave, or NumPy (when built against system BLAS).

IMPORTANT:
BLIS is a BLAS library only. It does NOT contain LAPACK.
If you replace a package that provided both (like standard Netlib CLAPACK
or OpenBLAS), ensure you have a separate LAPACK library installed to maintain
system stability.

Configuration:
This package is built with:
--enable-cblas
--enable-blas
--enable-threading=openmp
Target: Generic (amd64 for x86_64, x86 for 32-bit) to ensure portability.
