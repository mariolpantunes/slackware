blis: blis (BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software)
blis:
blis: BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-
blis: performance BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework
blis: was designed to isolate essential kernels of computation that, when
blis: optimized, immediately enable optimized implementations of most of
blis: its commonly used and computationally intensive operations.
